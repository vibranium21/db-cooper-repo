 <h1> The search for D.B. cooper has been a needle in a haystack and the fbi hasnt solved it yet.</h1>
 <h2> Let's start with what he did and a picture of cooper.</h2>
  <img src="th.jpg" width="30%">
  <p> on thanksgiving eve 1971 a man with the alias dan cooper boarded a plane from portland to seattle
  it was just going to be a normal half-hour flight until about halfway through dan cooper gave a note to a stewardess
  then said "you might want  take  a look at that note, I have a bomb" Then demanded 200,000 dollars in 20 dollar bills and 4 parachutes.
  and then the plane circled for two hours while the feds got all of the equipment.
 then the plane landed and everyone  gto off except cooper the pilots and a couple of stewardesses then over the washington-nevada border at a forest he parachuted ut with all of the 
 cash never to be seen again.</p>
  
  <h1> Now, there are many theories about who he is</h1>
